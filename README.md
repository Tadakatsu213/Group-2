Background & Public Interest
COVID-19 has posed an unprecedented global challenge due to its rapid and wide spread transmission. Since its emergence in late 2019, the virus has impacted millions of lives, significantly affecting public health, economics, and daily life around the world. The pandemic has highlighted vulnerabilities in global healthcare systems and underscored the need for worldwide interventions.
Introduction of our Project
Why we need to profoundly understand this health crisis?
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It has critical impacts on the global situation.
Individuals: It spreads from person to person by respiratory droplets or small airborne particles when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and is in close contact with others. Vulnerable groups like individuals with underlying medical conditions or the elderly may have long-term or lethal impacts.
Public: Healthcare systems face the challenge such as shortages of medical supplies and healthcare staffs. Additionally, the pandemic triggered severe economic disruptions, including business closures, job losses, and reduced consumer spending.

Project Aim
Analysing the spread and impact of COVID-19 helps to monitor and control the risk of future outbreaks. It informs strategies for disease surveillance, healthcare resource allocation, and public health interventions.
