# Human Corona vs Other Common Respiratory Viruses
In my analysis, I focused on how prevalence of CoronaVirus compared with other common respiratory viruses and how these respiratory viruses contribute to global demographics. 

The most common respiratory viruses include:
● Influenza (A, B)
● Human Coronavirus (including COVID-19, MERS, and SARS)
● Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
● Rhinovirus
● Parainfluenza

## Pie Chart
During the pandemic period (2019-2022), COVID-19 represented 4.9% of the total distribution, indicating its widespread impact as a novel respiratory virus during this period.

## Line Chart
It demonstrated that the common flu significantly contributes to global epidemiology. We can also observe trends for Human Coronavirus, though it accounts for a smaller proportion. I believe that the percentage of contribution could be presented more directly and precisely.

## Scatter Plot based on continents
We can see the most respiratory-virus detected cases happend in AMR region, including North America and Sourth America. 

## Geographic Demonstration
As Oceania and Asia have overlapping definitions in this dataset, we may see an incomplete presentation on a map. However, it still indicates that detected human coronaviruses spread mostly in the AMR and Oceania regions (which includes the Asia region).

Overall, the Coronavirus is a novel respiratory virus whose prevalence peaked during the pandemic period. We need to consider its significance and analyze the risk of recurrence and derivative complications.
